# VLC Lab

_Our work around the fifth assignment of Dr. Mangold's [Wireless Networking and Mobile Computing 2021](http://www.vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?semkez=2021W&ansicht=KATALOGDATEN&lerneinheitId=147216&lang=en) at ETH Zürich._

This project attempts to demonstrate Visible Light Communication (VLC)[^1][^2] by implementing a simple two-way chat app. LED-equipped Arduinos Uno (flashed with an ETH driver program) serve as transceivers and are controlled by a Python script. The chat app ("VLChat") is accompanied by a stat collection program ("VLCollect") for further analysis. The notebook Findings.ipynb dives deeper into the topic.

## Path to the first execution

To install all dependecies, run `make`. (This assumes that your PIP version is installed as `pip` in `/bin`.)

To execute the code in `./vlchat/__main__.py`, for instance, run `sudo python3 vlchat` or the equivalent command on your machine. Administrator privileges are required for the interactive CLI only.
