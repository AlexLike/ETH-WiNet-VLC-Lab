    "# Assignment 5\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is about visible light communication (VLC). LEDs act as transceivers and communicate using protocols that ensure no difference to \"steady\" light is visible to humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the bandwidth of the optical spectrum?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThe optical or visible spectrum is the range of wavelengths that are visible to the human eye.\n",
    "\tIt ranges from 400THz (red) to around 800THz (violet). \n",
    "\tIn total we therefore get a bandwidth of around 400THZ, which is a lot!\t\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\tWe can estimate the maximum throughput to be around 400 terabits/s using Stefan Mangold's rule of thumb.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t\n",
    "Is the visible spectrum regulated?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tConserning frequency, the visible spectrum is not regulated.\n",
    "\tPowerful lightsources will however be regulated (such as strong lasers).\t\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t\n",
    "What is the difference between infrared and visible light?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tLight in the frequency range of 300GHz to 400 THz is classified as infrared light.\n",
    "\tInfrared light has a lower frequency than visible light and is therefore not visible\n",
    "\tto humans. \n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t\n",
    "Can infrared light penetrate water? Can visible light?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tLooking at the graph: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_absorption_by_water#/media/File:Absorption_spectrum_of_liquid_water.png)\n",
    "\tWe can see that the visible spectrum is absorbed the most in water.\n",
    "\tThis implies that visible light can barely penetrate water.\n",
    "\t50% of it is already absorbed within the first 10 meters. \n",
    "\tBlue light is absorbed least and may reach depths of 100 meters.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\tInfrared light is absorbed way less which means it is able to penetrate much deeper.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t\n",
    "How do submarines communicate through the ocean, when they operate below water surface?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThere are different possibilities depending on the depth of the submarine.\n",
    "\tIf it is near the water surface it may use (blue) light.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\tSince light becomes less viable for lower depths,\n",
    "\tsonar (physical waves) might be used.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\tThere is also the possibility of extremely low frequency radio waves,\n",
    "\tbut these require huge antennas which consume enormous amounts of power.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t\n",
    "How can an LED be used as a receiver?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tA LED behaves like a capacitor; It will slowly discharge after it is charged.\n",
    "\tThe LED discharges faster if there is incomming light. This effect can be measured \n",
    "\tand can therefore LEDs can be used to detect incomming light.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t\n",
    "What are the benefits of using an LED instead of a photodiode as a receiver in consumer electronics?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tIn consumer electronics cost plays a big role. If we are able to reuse the LED as a receiver, \n",
    "\twe do not have to add additional hardware in the form of a photodiode. \n",
    "\tThis massively reduces cost especially in products where it is for example very expensive to add a hole\n",
    "\tfor a photodiode. \n",
    "\tWith the LED as a receiver we simply have to change the microchip without further costs.\n",
    "\t\n",
