Step 4:

Idea for the chat application:

	-main chat app has:
		- arduino listener thread
			listens to the port and sends read messages to queue (see example code here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html)
			in the main app.
		
		- console listener thread
			upon reading a input string 
			=> 	build command (format: ##: "...msg...\0" where ## is replaced with sender address)
				check for max-Size constraints and print error to console if not compliant.
				
			=> send to main app (add to queue or similar)
		
		- writer function
			when called, will send the command immediately.
			assumes the caller to wait until previous response was received.
		
	main:
		
		#init arduino
		#init listener threads 		
	
		while true:
			if(arduinoQueue not empty)
				print arduinoQueue.pop()
			
			if(consoleQueue not empty)
				if(delay over)
					pop and send command
					reset delay
						
				
		
		
Issues/Notes:
	-learn how to use threads in python!
		=> correctly implement the interface between the main thread and the listener threads.
		
	-no use for Step 5.
